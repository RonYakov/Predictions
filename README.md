# Predictions
Predictions - Java application
 
During my second year of computer science, I enrolled in a Java course and embarked on a project called "Predictions." The primary objective of this project was to create a system capable of defining a virtual "world" housing a population and applying a set of dynamic "laws" to this population. These laws would inherently alter certain entities within the world, albeit in a statistically modeled fashion.
The system itself was designed to be highly versatile, allowing for the definition of various entities and the laws that govern them. In essence, it provided a robust infrastructure and fertile ground for conducting a wide array of simulations.
We also implemented multithreading in our project, allowing us to run multiple simulations in parallel. This feature greatly enhanced the efficiency and scalability of our system, enabling us to explore various scenarios concurrently.
 
# Phases:
 
First Exercise: We initiated the project as a console application, laying the foundation for the core functionality.
Second Exercise: Building upon our initial work, we evolved the project into a desktop application using JavaFX. This transition introduced a more user-friendly and visually appealing interface to interact with the simulation.
 
Overall, our "Predictions" project represented a comprehensive journey through the world of Java programming and simulation development, ultimately providing a versatile platform for conducting various simulations and experiments.
